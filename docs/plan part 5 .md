1️⃣ What’s still missing (or could be tightened up)
#	Item	Why it matters	Current status
A	B2B / combo visual indicator	Gives players a quick read‑out of current combo, a key selling point in the “next steps” list.	Mentioned as what’s next → not yet implemented.
B	Persisted hot‑key / settings storage	Settings disappear when the app is restarted unless they’re saved to disk.	Hot‑key changes work in‑session, but persistence isn’t confirmed.
C	Cross‑platform packaging (Windows exe, macOS .app, Linux AppImage or pip wheel)	Makes the tool easy to distribute to friends or the wider community.	No installer / packaging scripts yet.
D	Automated UI‑test suite (e.g. pytest‑qt + screen‑capture mock)	Guarantees future refactors won’t break the dialog or overlay.	Only unit‑tests exist; no UI‑tests.
E	Performance profiling (CPU % / FPS of overlay)	Ghost‑piece rendering must stay < 30 ms per frame to feel responsive.	No numbers collected yet.
F	Documentation & user guide	Users need a quick‑start “how‑to‑run” page and an API reference for developers.	README exists, but no detailed guide.
G	Error handling / graceful degradation (e.g. missing game window, corrupted DB)	Prevents crashes when the Tetris window isn’t found or the DB is locked.	Basic logging in place, but no UI‑level fallback.
H	Static‑analysis cleanup (Pyright warnings)	The IDE currently warns “Enumeration of workspace source files … >10 s”. This slows down the dev loop.	Ignore lists are in playrightconfig.json; the file name and path format are still wrong.
I	Feature toggle for “ghost pieces”	Some users may want just the stats dashboard; a toggle makes the overlay optional.	Hard‑coded to always launch.
2️⃣ Suggested Roadmap (next 2‑3 weeks)
Sprint	Goal	Tasks (estimated effort)	Owner / Notes
Sprint 1 (≈ 5 days)	Stabilise the dev environment & ship a minimal installer	1. Add a proper pyrightconfig.json (see §3 below).
2. Convert the existing playrightconfig.json to a .codeiumignore file (git‑ignore syntax).
3. Verify the “Enumeration >10 s” warning is gone.
4. Add a tiny CLI wrapper (tetris‑overlay --install) that builds a single‑file executable with PyInstaller (Windows) / briefcase (macOS) / AppImage (Linux).
5. Write a “Quick‑Start” section in README.md.	1 day for config fix, 2 days for packaging script, 1 day docs, 1 day testing.
Sprint 2 (≈ 5 days)	Persist settings & hot‑keys	1. Serialize the Settings model to a JSON file on exit.
2. Load the JSON on start‑up (fallback to defaults).
3. Add a “Reset to defaults” button.
4. Write unit‑tests for the persistor.	2 days of coding + 1 day tests.
Sprint 3 (≈ 6 days)	Add B2B / combo visual indicator	1. Define the combo‑state data model (current streak, max streak, multiplier).
2. Draw a small overlay badge (e.g. “× 3”) near the ghost piece.
3. Make the badge configurable (color, position).
4. Update the stats DB schema to store combo events.
5. Add a unit‑test that verifies the badge is shown only when combo > 1.	4 days dev, 2 days QA.
Sprint 4 (≈ 4 days)	Performance & reliability	1. Add a lightweight FPS/CPU‑usage monitor (Qt label).
2. Profile the detection loop (timeit/cProfile).
3. Optimise the screen‑capture region (use DirectX on Windows if needed).
4. Add graceful fallback when the Tetris window cannot be found (show toast + retry).	2 days profiling/fixes, 2 days polish.
Sprint 5 (≈ 3 days)	Automated UI tests & CI	1. Add pytest-qt tests for the Settings dialog (open → change → save).
2. Extend the CI pipeline to run UI tests in a headless Xvfb container (Linux).
3. Ensure Pyright runs as part of CI (npm run lint style).	3 days.
Optional Overflow	Feature toggle, multi‑profile support, B2B analytics export	If you finish the above early, you can add a “Enable Ghost‑Pieces” checkbox and an “Export combo CSV” button.	+1 day each.
Total effort ≈ 28 person‑days. If you have a second developer, split the work in half and you could finish in 2 weeks.

3️⃣ Fixing the “Enumeration of workspace source files is taking longer than 10 seconds” problem
You already have a huge ignore list, but the language server is still seeing it because:

Issue	What to do
Wrong file name – you used playrightconfig.json. Pyright only reads pyrightconfig.json (or [tool.pyright] in pyproject.toml).	Rename the file to pyrightconfig.json and place it exactly in the folder that you open as a workspace (the one shown by Server root directory: in the Windsurf → Pyright output).
Windows back‑slashes – patterns like C:\\\\TetrisOverlay/** are not recognised.	Use forward slashes or relative paths, e.g. "TetrisOverlay/**" or "C:/TetrisOverlay/**".
Absolute paths – any leading / makes the pattern absolute, which Pyright ignores on Windows.	Keep everything relative to the config location.
Duplicate/default excludes – you don’t need **/.git/**, **/__pycache__/**, **/node_modules/** – Pyright already excludes them.	Clean them up; they don’t hurt but make the file easier to read.
Missing .codeiumignore – Windsurf’s own indexing (Cascade) still scans the files because it only looks at .codeiumignore.	Create a .codeiumignore file in the repo root with the same glob list (git‑ignore syntax). Then enable Cascade → Gitignore Access in Windsurf Settings (top‑right dropdown → Settings → “Cascade Gitignore Access”).
Symlinks – if you have a symlink that points outside the workspace, Pyright follows it before it can apply the exclude rule.	Add the symlink path itself to exclude (e.g. "linked_folder/**"), or delete/replace the symlink.
Multi‑root workspace – if you opened several folders at once, only the folder that contains the config gets the list.	Add a pyrightconfig.json to each root, or open a single root.
Example pyrightconfig.json (cleaned up):

{
    // No "include" – defaults to the folder that holds this file
    "exclude": [
        "vcpkg/**",
        "build/**",
        "TetrisOverlay/**",
        "**/node_modules/**",
        "**/dist/**",
        "**/*.egg-info/**",
        "**/*.zip",
        "**/*.onnx",
        "tools/**",
        "downloads/**",
        "buildtrees/**",
        "packages/**",
        "installed/**",
        "cpp_binding/**",
        "**/*.exe",
        "**/*.dll",
        "**/*.so",
        "**/*.dylib",
        "**/test_*.py",
        "**/debug_*.py",
        "**/*.log",
        "**/*.tmp",
        "temp/**",
        "cache/**",
        ".venv/**",
        "legacy/**",
        "artifacts/**",
        "game_screenshots/**",
        "**/*.png",
        "**/*.jpg",
        "**/*.jpeg",
        "**/*.bmp",
        "**/*.gif",
        "verification_temp/**",
        "tetris-artifacts/**"
    ],
    "logLevel": "information"
}
.codeiumignore (same patterns, Git‑ignore syntax):

vcpkg/
build/
TetrisOverlay/
node_modules/
dist/
*.egg-info/
*.zip
*.onnx
tools/
downloads/
buildtrees/
packages/
installed/
cpp_binding/
*.exe
*.dll
*.so
*.dylib
test_*.py
debug_*.py
*.log
*.tmp
temp/
cache/
.venv/
legacy/
artifacts/
game_screenshots/
*.png
*.jpg
*.jpeg
*.bmp
*.gif
verification_temp/
tetris-artifacts/
After you restart the language server, the “Enumeration … longer than 10 seconds” warning should disappear, and the IDE will be snappier.

4️⃣ Next‑Step Checklist (you can copy‑paste)
[ ] Rename playrightconfig.json → pyrightconfig.json
[ ] Convert absolute Windows paths to forward‑slash / relative globs
[ ] Add a .codeiumignore file with the same patterns
[ ] Enable “Cascade Gitignore Access” in Windsurf Settings
[ ] Restart Windsurf / language server, verify “Using config file:” appears
[ ] Confirm the warning is gone (Output → Windsurf → Pyright)
[ ] Implement persistence for Settings & hot‑keys (JSON file)
[ ] Build a minimal installer (PyInstaller / Briefcase)
[ ] Write Quick‑Start docs in README
[ ] Add B2B/combo visual indicator (badge overlay)
[ ] Add performance monitor (FPS label) and profile the loop
[ ] Write UI tests with pytest‑qt, add to CI
[ ] Package final release, tag version, generate changelog
What I need from you
Confirm the scope – Do you want to tackle all items above, or only the most critical ones (e.g., IDE warning + persistence + packaging)?
Current repository layout – Where do you open Windsurf (which folder is the workspace root)? This helps confirm where the pyrightconfig.json should live.
Target platforms – Is Windows the only platform you ship to, or do you need macOS/Linux builds as well?
Any blockers – Are there compile‑time errors, missing dependencies, or things in the overlay code that are still “TODO”?
Once I have those answers I can refine the timeline (e.g., split the tasks into “day 1‑2: IDE fixes”, “day 3‑5: persistence & packaging”, …) and give you concrete git commands / CI snippets.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed! 🚀
